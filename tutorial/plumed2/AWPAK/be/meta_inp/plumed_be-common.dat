# randomize the exchange (not between consecutive indeces, here just 2 replicas, so it is not relevant)
RANDOM_EXCHANGES
# set up the two torsion collective variables 
# omega (use cv1 so it will be compatible with the METAGUI analysis plugin)
cv1: TORSION ATOMS=19,40,42,45
# psi (use cv2 so it will be compatible with the METAGUI analysis plugin)
cv2: TORSION ATOMS=41,45,53,55

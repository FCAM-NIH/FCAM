# Software tools for free energy analysis based on the force-correction analysis method

This repository includes:

calcf_vgauss.py: python program to calculate mean forces based on the Force-Correction Analysis Method.

graf_fes_kmc.py: python program to derive the free energy landscape and minimum free energy paths from the mean forces based on a kinetic Monte Carlo approach.

FCAM_software_doc.pdf: documentation and examples.

tutorial: examples folders.

tools: awk/bash scripts for one-dimensional free energy integration and partitioning neighbors search.
